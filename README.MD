Lyle McCaffrey and Brett Bittola

Code adapted from the full program at https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app/tree/main/

Variables, and specific code structures were adapted to fit this project, but the overall code and project structures belongs to the original source.

The five tables we have included are Media, Customers, Copies, Types, and Creators. All five tables have read and add functions. Customers and Copies also have delete capabilities, while Copies also has the ability to update a copies customer or media ID. Copies also has a nullable relationship with customer ID.
